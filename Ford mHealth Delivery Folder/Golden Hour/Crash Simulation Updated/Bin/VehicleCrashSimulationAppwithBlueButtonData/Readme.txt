Vehicle Crash Simulation App:

1. The APK VehicleSimulationCrashApp.apk need to installed on an Android Tab (ver 4.0 on above) with a normal installation process.

2. Tab size should be 10" ideally. Though it may fit well at a 7" tab as well. UI is not flexible at the stage to get it fit at smaller size in smart phones. Though app will run in smart phone as well, UI may not fit well.

3. Vehicle detects crash in simulation in few seconds and then a button on top right displays "Medical Data Records"

4. Clicking on this button parses and displays the BlueButton xml file on the screen.

5. The Blue button xml file is embedded in the apk itself at the stage. The same file (bbsample.xml) is also put there in same Git folder for ref.
